# Daosky Canister Documentation

## Overview
The Daosky canister is a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) platform built on the Internet Computer Protocol (ICP). It enables users to create, manage, and participate in DAOs, providing a robust set of functionalities for decentralized governance and decision-making.

## Code Explanation

### Actor: Daosky
The `Daosky` actor encapsulates the core functionalities of the DAO platform, including DAO creation, membership management, proposal creation and management, token minting, DAO status management, information retrieval, and DAO update/delete operations.

#### Function: createDao
- **Logic**: This function allows users to create a new DAO by providing essential details such as the name, subject, logo, and initial status. It generates a unique ID for the new DAO and initializes the necessary data structures.
- **Parameters**: `payload` - Contains the details of the new DAO.
- **Return**: Returns the unique ID of the newly created DAO.

#### Function: leaveDao
- **Logic**: Enables a member to leave a DAO, updating the list of delegates and token balances accordingly.
- **Parameters**: `daoId` - The ID of the DAO from which the member wants to leave.
- **Return**: Returns a success message upon successful departure from the DAO.

#### Function: joinDao
- **Logic**: Allows a member to join a DAO, updating the list of delegates and token balances accordingly.
- **Parameters**: `id` - The ID of the DAO to join.
- **Return**: Returns a success message upon successful joining of the DAO.

#### Function: addCallerToPrivateDao
- **Logic**: Adds a caller to a private DAO, subject to access control and token balance requirements.
- **Parameters**: `daoId` - The ID of the DAO, `callerToAdd` - The Principal of the caller to be added.
- **Return**: Returns a success message upon successful addition of the caller to the DAO.

#### Function: voteProposal
- **Logic**: Enables members to vote on proposals within a DAO, updating the vote count and proposal state based on the voting outcome.
- **Parameters**: `daoId` - The ID of the DAO, `proposalId` - The ID of the proposal, `vote` - The vote (true/false).
- **Return**: Returns a success message upon successful submission of the vote.

#### Function: checkAndExecuteProposal
- **Logic**: Checks and executes a proposal based on the voting outcome and proposal state.
- **Parameters**: `daoId` - The ID of the DAO, `proposalId` - The ID of the proposal.
- **Return**: Returns a success message upon successful execution of the proposal.

#### Function: mintToken
- **Logic**: Allows a member to mint new tokens for themselves, subject to token balance limits.
- **Parameters**: `daoId` - The ID of the DAO, `Amount` - The amount of tokens to mint.
- **Return**: Returns a success message upon successful token minting.

#### Function: changeDaoStatus
- **Logic**: Enables the creator of a DAO to change its status, subject to token balance requirements.
- **Parameters**: `id` - The ID of the DAO, `newStatus` - The new status of the DAO.
- **Return**: Returns a success message upon successful change of the DAO status.

#### Function: getProposal
- **Logic**: Retrieves a specific proposal within a DAO based on the proposal ID.
- **Parameters**: `daoId` - The ID of the DAO, `proposalId` - The ID of the proposal.
- **Return**: Returns the proposal details if found, or an error message if not found.

#### Function: createProposal
- **Logic**: Allows a member to create a proposal within a DAO, subject to token balance requirements.
- **Parameters**: `daoId` - The ID of the DAO, `title` - The title of the proposal, `description` - The description of the proposal.
- **Return**: Returns a success message upon successful creation of the proposal.

#### Function: getProposalsInDao
- **Logic**: Retrieves all proposals within a DAO.
- **Parameters**: `id` - The ID of the DAO.
- **Return**: Returns an array of proposals if found, or an error message if not found.

#### Function: getAllDao
- **Logic**: Retrieves all DAOs.
- **Return**: Returns an array of all DAOs.

#### Function: getDaoById
- **Logic**: Retrieves a specific DAO based on the DAO ID.
- **Parameters**: `id` - The ID of the DAO.
- **Return**: Returns the DAO details if found, or null if not found.

#### Function: deleteDao
- **Logic**: Deletes a specific DAO based on the DAO ID.
- **Parameters**: `id` - The ID of the DAO.

#### Function: updateDao
- **Logic**: Updates the details of a specific DAO based on the DAO ID.
- **Parameters**: `id` - The ID of the DAO, `payload` - The updated details of the DAO.
- **Return**: Returns a success message upon successful update of the DAO.

#### Function: RandomNum
- **Logic**: Generates a random number for internal use within the canister.

## Obstacles Faced
1. **Data Object Creation**: Creating new data objects for every change in the data type added complexity to the system.
2. **Token Deployment Issue**: When attempting to deploy a dummy token for each DAO, a cycle error occurred while calling from the Candid UI, leading to the need to find an alternative approach for integrating the dummy token.
3. **Array Complexity**: Managing a large number of arrays proved to be tricky due to their intricate nature, requiring careful handling and testing.

## Potential Improvements
1. **Error Handling**: Enhance error handling to anticipate and manage potential runtime errors and edge cases.
2. **Code Modularity**: Further modularize the code to enhance readability, maintainability, and reusability of code segments.
3. **Security Considerations**: Conduct a thorough security review to ensure robust protection against potential vulnerabilities.
4. **Optimization**: Identify opportunities to optimize certain operations, such as array manipulations, for improved performance and efficiency.
5. **Documentation**: Add inline comments and documentation to explain complex logic and data structures for enhanced comprehensibility.

## Conclusion
The Daosky canister provides a comprehensive set of functionalities for managing decentralized autonomous organizations, empowering users to create, participate in, and govern community-driven initiatives. The platform's features are designed to foster transparent, inclusive, and effective decentralized governance, with a strong focus on error handling and security to ensure the reliability and integrity of DAO operations.
